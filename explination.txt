inputs are passed into one of two methods that make this work. First search_dir takes in the path name you want to start the search from and the name of the directory you want to find and show the contents of. search_dir() opens the starting directory and checks it's findings to see if they are directories or not. Directories that match what's being searched for are passed to the second method, show_content(char *path), and all directories are called into search_dir() again recursivly to search the subdirectories.
